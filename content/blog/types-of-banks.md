Have you ever walked down the street in any town bigger than a few square blocks and been surprised by how many financial institutions you passed by? You're not alone. Living in a small town, I frequently come across another one I hadn't noticed before, each time wondering things like:

- Why are there so many and seemingly different kinds?
- Why are some really nice but always seem empty?
- Why would I choose one over another? 

So I sat down and did some research to help answer these questions. While the answers I got were more complex than I imagined, in this post, I will highlight the primary differences and some similarities between all the different types you might come across.

For me, it'll help me make sense of some of the jargon tossed around in meetings. For you, it could help land you a new job. It might even be mine! Let's go!

## Types of Banks
### Central Banks
In the United States, this is our nation's primary authority, known as the Federal Reserve. They are responsible for the monetary policy of the country, which includes tasks like like distributing currency, managing interest rates, and regulating commercial banks.

### Commercial Banks
These are the name-brand banks we're all familiar with (e.g., JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc.). They serve the basic needs of most businesses and people by offering a robust list of services like checking accounts, savings accounts, loans, mortgages, credit cards, merchant services, cash management, lines of credit, business credit cards, and more. As such, they are the most common type of bank.

### Retail Banks
This is another term for your typical bank, but it primarily focuses on the individual rather than the business. Within the United States, virtually all commercial banks also offer retail services, but the experience is so seamless you never have to consider the difference between the two.

### Corporate / Business Banks
As the name implies, these banks specifically work with businesses of various sizes. While providing standard services like loans, credit, and cash management, they may also help with equipment lending and financing.

### Investment Banks
An investment bank primarily works with businesses and governments to provide financial services. These services include things like managing the issuing, purchasing, and trading of securities, as well as raising capital and providing counsel. 

Securities are things like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, and derivatives. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch are all examples of investment banks.

### Private Banks
Reserved for those with a high net worth, private banks cater to individuals with a lot of money the bank can invest. Think of this as the white-glove experience in banking.

### Credit Unions
These operate as non-profit organizations that provide many of the same services as commercial or retail banks. However, because they have no shareholders to disburse their earnings to, they can reinvest that money into the bank and offer better services, rates, and lower fees to their members.

### Online Banks
Here are banks that function exclusively online, with no physical branches. As a result, they can offer most of the standard services like checking accounts, savings accounts, and loans while also providing convenient perks that, for their members, make up for the lack of face-to-face contact. Examples of online banks include Ally and Chime.

### Community Banks
These institutions focus on a specific geographic area and are typically involved with local causes, organizations, and businesses. This allows them to fund efforts that larger banks would determine are too risky. While similar to credit unions in many ways, they differ in that community banks may be privately owned or publicly traded.

### Cooperative / Mutual Banks
A cooperative or mutual bank is owned and controlled by its members. When decisions need to be made, each member has one vote, which involves them in decision-making. Because of its structure, profits are either reinvested back into the bank or distributed to its members.

### Islamic Banks
Operating under Islamic law (Shariah), these banks operate under different principles in their religious adherence. Some of these include not charging interest, linking transactions to tangible assets, prohibition of ambiguity in agreements, and refusing to finance ventures that are considered sinful.

### Development Banks
Often backed by national or international institutions, development banks aim to serve the underserved. This is done by providing financing and counsel to businesses and initiatives that might not be able to acquire funding from larger banks due to their risk profile.

## Conclusion
As you can see, each type of financial institution plays a unique role in our pursuit of economic stability and growth. The sheer variety of options demonstrates the complexity of the financial sector as it responds to the needs of customers, societies, and economies. While understanding this ecosystem may help us navigate our own decisions surrounding money, it also sheds light on the intricate workings of our economy.

As you may guess from this post, a lot goes into defining what makes one financial institution from another. So feel free to dig deeper if you are interested! I genuinely hope that you learned as much as I did and that you treat every new piece of knowledge as an investment in yourself!
