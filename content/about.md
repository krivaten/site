Life is full of battles, and let's be honest, it's not going to get any easier any time soon.

Like you, challenges have come to me in several ways. For example, I was born with a bleeding disorder that has hung like the sword of Damocles over my head for my entire life, forcing me to wonder if it will be the thing that gets me in the end.

Most recently, my wife and I were gifted with a special needs son. As a result, we've had to learn to navigate life in a way we never expected while trying to parent our other three kids.

I've also battled depression, anxiety, suicide, faith, church, marriage, community, and more. But **I'm nothing special**. Chances are, you've marched across many of those battlefields as well.

Along the way, I've found safe passage through my faith, stoicism, elements of mysticism, psychedelics, and my pursuit of encouraging others toward meaning and community.

Maybe you'll relate to me in feeling like we've made life so much more complicated than it needs to be. Or perhaps you're like I *used* to be, stuck, waiting for a voice from the sky to dictate every step we're supposed to take.

But sometimes, patience is a complete waste of time. **Let's start by building momentum**, one muddy and sloppy step at a time. Together, we'll explore how to have a healthier outlook and break down outdated stigmas we've accrued within our lives, our faith, and our philosophy.

Towards life and towards love.
