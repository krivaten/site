## Text

Endure and persist, this pain will turn to good. Rejection of desire leads to tranquility. Wisdom is the most valuable asset. Consider the nature of all things, seek truth in adversity. Practice tolerance and understanding, for judgment leads to suffering.

Wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance, the cardinal virtues of life. Distinguish between what is in your control and what is not. Accept fate, for it is the nature of life. The universe is change, life is an opinion. The obstacle on the path becomes the way.

Consider not what brings you joy or sorrow, but what brings you closer to virtue. The universe is governed by law, harmonize with it. Strive not for pleasure or success, but for equanimity and virtue. The best revenge is to not become like the one who harmed you.

Life is fleeting, focus not on the past or the future, but on the present. Find serenity in accepting what happens. To accept without arrogance, to let go with indifference, such is the way of nature. The sole good in life is living according to reason, the sole evil is living contrary to it.

We got some **bold text**, some *italic text*, and some ~~strikethrough text~~.
